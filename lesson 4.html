<h2>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</h2>

<p>Healthcare has changed a lot in recent years because of new technology and the need for better patient care. Many current patient management systems work separately, which can lead to problems like missing information and poor communication among doctors and nurses. This can make it harder to
provide good care to patients.</p>

<p>Some of the main issues in managing include delays in accessing records, misunderstandings between healthcare workers, and difficulty in giving personalized care. These problems can slow down healthcare services and affect the quality of care patients receive. That’s why creating an integrated patient management system is important. Such a system can help share information easily, ensure that healthcare workers have the information they need when they need it, and improve patient health outcomes.</p>

This study will look into how to design and use an integrated patient management system to fix these issues in healthcare delivery. By understanding the benefits and challenges of these systems, this research will help improve healthcare services using technology.
1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many patient management systems in healthcare are not connected well, which causes problems in providing good care. These systems can lead to delays in getting patient information, misunderstandings between healthcare workers, and poor coordination of care. Because of this, patients might have to wait longer, face more medical mistakes, and not get personalized care. Also, when healthcare professionals can't access complete patient data quickly, it makes it hard for them to make the right decisions, which can hurt patient outcomes. This study wants to find out what’s wrong with current patient management practices and create a system that fixes these issues. By improving communication, sharing information, and making patient care more efficient, this research aims to make healthcare better for everyone.

<h2>1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</h2>

1. To look at how well existing patient management systems work and how they affect patients 
2. To create a new patient management system that helps healthcare professionals communicate and
share information easily.
3. To see how the new system could improve healthcare delivery and make patients happier.
4. To give advice to healthcare facilities on how to use integrated patient management systems to
improve care quality.
1.4 SCOPES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
Scope:
The study will focus on developing an integrated patient management system specifically for healthcare
facilities. It will look at how this system can improve communication, data sharing, and overall patient care. The research will involve gathering information from healthcare workers, analyzing current systems, and testing the new system in real-world settings.
Limitations:
There may be some limitations to the study, such as a limited number of healthcare facilities involved, which could affect the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, there might be challenges in getting all healthcare workers to adopt the new system, and the study may not cover every possible issue related to patient management. Lastly, time and resources might restrict the depth of the research. 
1.5 SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH
<p>The study is important because it aims to improve how healthcare is delivered by creating a better patient management system. By addressing the problems that healthcare workers face with current systems, this research can lead to faster access to patient information, fewer mistakes, and better coordination of care. This will ultimately help patients receive the right treatment more quickly and improve their overall health outcomes. Additionally, the findings can guide healthcare facilities in adopting new technologies, making healthcare more efficient and patient-centered.</p>
