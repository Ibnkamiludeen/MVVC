<p>There are several types of variables, including independent, dependent, categorical, quantitative, and intervening variables. They can be used to represent quantities in word problems, or to describe characteristics in research and statistics. Independent variables Also known as experimental or predictor variables, these are variables that are manipulated in an experiment The effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable is observed</p>

<ol>
	<li>Dependent variables: Also known as outcome variables, these are variables that are being tested in an experiment The outcome of the experiment is measured to see how other variables affect the dependent variable</li>
	<li>Categorical variables: Also known as qualitative variables, these variables represent types or categories that are used to group observations They divide data into distinct groups that lack a numerical value</li>
	<li>Quantitative variable: These variables can be counted or measured numerically They can be continuous or discrete Continuous variables can take an infinite set of values Discrete variables can only take certain numeric values</li>
	<li>Intervening variables: Also known as mediator variables, these are hypothetical variables that explain the cause of the link between other variables</li>
